Horse racing prediction machine based off racing charts

## Data

I'm using Santa Anita as my test. I grabbed PDFs of their charts for the month of January. If that seems like not enough data, I'll grab it for the rest of the months they of their racing season.

I used numpy to get turn the PDFs into text files that are easy to parse through. I was trying.

## Goals

To use the chart data and some machine learning to come up with a formula to predict horse racing results.

## Predictions

I'm predicting that from the information I can get from the charts, the most important factors will be trainer and jockey. The rest will almost not matter.


## Usage

1. Grab cards from Equibase for training purposes
2. Put card PDFs in cards directory
